# Kivy-The-Lab
# Kivy Layout Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating the use of various Kivy layouts. Kivy is a popular Python library for building multi-touch applications. In this repo, you'll find examples of the following Kivy layouts:

- **PageLayout**
- **ScrollView**
- **StackLayout**
- **GridLayout**
- **BoxLayout**
- **AnchorLayout**

Each layout is demonstrated with a simple application showcasing its features and use cases.

## Introduction

Kivy provides several layout containers to help developers create responsive and well-structured UIs. The examples in this repository illustrate how to use each of these layouts effectively in a Kivy application. These layouts make it easier to organize widgets on the screen based on the desired behavior (e.g., stacking widgets, grid organization, scrolling, etc.).

## Layouts Included

### PageLayout

This layout provides a paginated view, where you can manage different pages in a sequence. The PageLayout is useful for scenarios where the user navigates between multiple screens, similar to tabs or slides.

### ScrollView

ScrollView is used when you need to display content that is larger than the screen. This layout adds scrollability to the widgets within it, making it ideal for applications with long forms, lists, or image galleries.

### StackLayout

StackLayout arranges widgets in a single line, either horizontally or vertically. The widgets are stacked on top of each other in a sequence based on the chosen orientation.

### GridLayout

GridLayout organizes widgets in a grid, defined by rows and columns. This layout is ideal for forms or applications that require a well-structured, table-like display.

### BoxLayout

BoxLayout arranges widgets in either a vertical or horizontal box. It is commonly used for simpler layouts, such as toolbars or menus, where widgets are aligned in a single row or column.

### AnchorLayout

AnchorLayout positions widgets based on anchor points (top, bottom, left, right, center). This layout is useful for scenarios where you want to place a widget at a specific location relative to its parent container.

## Requirements

To run the examples in this repository, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Kivy 2.x

To install Kivy, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install kivy
